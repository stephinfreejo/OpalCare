            <ul>
                <li>Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020, or nearly one in six deaths.</li>
                <li>The most common cancers are breast, lung, colon and rectum, and prostate cancers.</li>
                <li>Around one-third of deaths from cancer are due to tobacco use, high body mass index, alcohol consumption, low fruit and vegetable intake, and lack of physical activity. In addition, air pollution is an important risk factor for lung cancer.</li>
                <li>Cancer-causing infections, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis, are responsible for approximately 30% of cancer cases in low- and lower-middle-income countries.</li>
                <li>Many cancers can be cured if detected early and treated effectively.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Overview -->
        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>
            <p>Cancer is a generic term for a large group of diseases that can affect any part of the body. Other terms used are malignant tumors and neoplasms. One defining feature of cancer is the rapid creation of abnormal cells that grow beyond their usual boundaries, and which can then invade adjoining parts of the body and spread to other organs; the latter process is referred to as metastasis. Widespread metastases are the primary cause of death from cancer.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- The Problem -->
        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="section-heading">The Problem</h2>
            <p>Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020. The most common cancers in 2020 (in terms of new cases) were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Breast (2.26 million cases)</li>
                <li>Lung (2.21 million cases)</li>
                <li>Colon and rectum (1.93 million cases)</li>
                <li>Prostate (1.41 million cases)</li>
                <li>Skin (non-melanoma) (1.20 million cases)</li>
                <li>Stomach (1.09 million cases)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The most common causes of cancer death in 2020 were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lung (1.80 million deaths)</li>
                <li>Colon and rectum (916,000 deaths)</li>
                <li>Liver (830,000 deaths)</li>
                <li>Stomach (769,000 deaths)</li>
                <li>Breast (685,000 deaths)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each year, approximately 400,000 children develop cancer. Cervical cancer is the most common in 23 countries.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Causes -->
        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Causes</h2>
            <p>Cancer arises from the transformation of normal cells into tumor cells in a multi-stage process that generally progresses from a pre-cancerous lesion to a malignant tumor. These changes are the result of the interaction between a person's genetic factors and three categories of external agents:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Physical carcinogens, such as ultraviolet and ionizing radiation</li>
                <li>Chemical carcinogens, such as asbestos, components of tobacco smoke, alcohol, aflatoxin (a food contaminant), and arsenic (a drinking water contaminant)</li>
                <li>Biological carcinogens, such as infections from certain viruses, bacteria, or parasites</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The incidence of cancer rises dramatically with age, most likely due to a build-up of risks for specific cancers that increase with age.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Risk Factors -->
        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Risk Factors</h2>
            <p>Tobacco use, alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and air pollution are risk factors for cancer and other noncommunicable diseases.</p>
            <p>Some chronic infections are risk factors for cancer; this is a particular issue in low- and middle-income countries. Approximately 13% of cancers diagnosed in 2018 globally were attributed to carcinogenic infections, including Helicobacter pylori, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and Epstein-Barr virus.</p>
            <p>Hepatitis B and C viruses and some types of HPV increase the risk for liver and cervical cancer, respectively. Infection with HIV increases the risk of developing cervical cancer six-fold and substantially increases the risk of developing select other cancers such as Kaposi sarcoma.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Reducing the Burden -->
        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Reducing the Burden</h2>
            <p>Between 30â€“50% of cancers can currently be prevented by avoiding risk factors and implementing existing evidence-based prevention strategies. The cancer burden can also be reduced through early detection of cancer and management of patients who develop cancer.</p>
            <p>Modifying or avoiding the following risk factors can help prevent cancer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>tobacco use (responsible for approximately 22% of cancer deaths)</li>
                <li>being overweight or obese</li>
                <li>unhealthy diet with low fruit and vegetable intake</li>
                <li>lack of physical activity</li>
                <li>alcohol use</li>
                <li>sexually transmitted HPV-infection</li>
                <li>infection by hepatitis or other carcinogenic infections</li>
                <li>ionizing and ultraviolet radiation</li>
                <li>urban air pollution</li>
                <li>indoor smoke from household use of solid fuels</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Not using tobacco is the single most important factor for cancer prevention.</p>
            <p>Vaccination against HPV and hepatitis B virus can prevent 1 million cancer cases each year.</p>
            <p>Early detection: There are two components of early detection efforts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Early diagnosis: Awareness of early signs and symptoms (e.g., cervical, breast, colorectal, and oral cancer) to ensure prompt treatment.</li>
                <li>Screening: Systematic screening programs to identify early signs of cancer. Examples include mammography for breast cancer and HPV testing for cervical cancer.</li>
            </ul>
